# My NeoVIM Config

My NeoVIM config based on NeoVIM GigaChad ThePrimeagen's setup.

See here for a description of most of the configuration:

[0 to LSP: Neovim RC from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE)

## Installation

A fairly recent NeoVIM (i.e. >= 0.9) is needed.

Checkout the repo somewhere, rename your ~/.config to e.g. ~/.config.bak
and then do a `ln -s $PWD/neovim-config ~/.config`

In nvim, enter `:PackerSync` - this should download all plugins.

That's all :)
